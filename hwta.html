                            <span class="tertiary_highlight">Häxan</span> (The Witch) uses vignettes, wood carvings, illustrations and more to chart the historical roots and superstitions surrounding witchcraft, beginning in the Middle Ages through the 1900s. Considered to be one of the most important silent films ever made, Häxan trailblazed a myriad of formal and genre techniques, setting the stage for horror and documentary films to follow. This retrospective explores the film's themes, technicals, and thesis.

                        <h3>Departing from / Iterating on "The Green Knight"</h3>
                        <p>
                            When I set out to make this video, I originally intended it as a stopgap — an aside, no more than 5 minutes,
                            meant to practice After Effects and, in doing so, address some of the immediate problems in "The Green Knight",
                            the most blatant being its approach to still images.
                            Of course, with time, the project grew, and so too did its goals. Then, more than just an excuse to practice new
                            toolings, I was driven to iterate on, to "fix" everything I felt didn't work in the previous retrospective. I 
                            wanted this to be a sort of baseline (it wouldn't), to meet a level of quality that I would be "OK" with months 
                            or years down the line (it didn't).   
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="col_container full_width">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            As in so many ways, it became reactionary; <span class="tertiary_highlight">"Häxan" was a significant departure from
                            "The Green Knight"</span>: the editing was less bombastic, less willing to try new things, yet more motivated and 
                            consistent; the sound effects (at least in the introduction) received much more attention and care; the voice over
                            was slowed down considerably, in both its pace and placement (i.e., I talked slower and arranged each VO snippet 
                            further apart); more to that point, the tempo of the entire video was slowed, the goal being to let the video
                            "breathe", to take its time, to not be so overwrought; the structure of the script 
                            (a benefit of "Häxan" being plotless) dove right in
                            to a discussion of its themes and interpretations, avoiding the chronological (read disastorous) approach of 
                            "The Green Knight"; the music was licensed rather than repurposed; the film (although, not the restoration)
                            existed in the public domain rather than with a copyright holder; and, above all else, more respect was paid
                            to the film, the footage not, for example, bastardized with colorization, the edits constrained, first and foremost,
                            by what I felt was appropriate for "Häxan" — not just for me. It's funny then, that, regardless of these changes, this
                            12-minute retrospective should feel just as tiring, just as draining, as the previous 38-minute one.
                        </p>

                            In other ways, however, it was a continutation of what I did previously, revising and iterating on old ideas,
                            old edits, just with more attention paid to how all these disparate elements should congeal. The overall style
                            was, of course, the same.
                            I discuss this more later, but the following set of photos illustrate this perfectly — what was a small
                            experiment in "The Green Knight", now revised and made into the main method of presenting images in "Häxan".

                            There were other carryovers, too, ones that I now regret: some phatic title cards, their message implied by the
                            context of the video, or others that just need not be included: "spoilers ahead"; "thank you for watching"; etc. 
                            The trigger warning at the start, for example, might not have been warranted, or would have been better served 
                            in the video description.

                            From the beginning, it was important to set out a series of constraints that the video needed to follow: 
                            as mentioned, it should be a
                            reflection of the film, at least in some form or fashion, however inane, however pointless; the color should be 
                            limited, monochromatic and aligned with the footage being shown; the font should resemble either that of the 
                            time period being depicted or the time period in which the film was made; and so on and so forth.

                            The easiest, most noticeable choice was a
                            visual likeness; the video begins with a slideshow-esque introduction, using a flickering, jittering virtual light,
                            to mirror the practical one used at the start of the film. The script, too, was meant to echo the film's intertitles 
                            (at least in the introduction, in spirit), with short, factual statements on the time period. Despite this, it's still, 
                            ostensibly and purposely, a modern edit; it conflicts, in that sense.

                            The introduction was drafted prior to the script being finished, to get, before recording the voice over, an idea of the
                            overall tone of the piece. I wanted it to feel mysterious and occult-like. Throughout, but most prominently in the introduction,
                            a chromatic aberration was applied to the images, to give off a slight 3D, lens distortion effect. Here, it's easiest seen
                            outlining the soldiers' helmets and guns.

                            Mentioned earlier, this is an example of the monochromatic approach to color. 
                            The footage, and a portion of the text, is tinted yellow
                            to draw association with disease and sickness. The flickering light (via both audio and visual cues) is used as a diegetic
                            transition to that color and, later, a separate hospital photograph.

                            Meant as a subplot critiquing silent film directors and their oft-attributed "iron fist" approach to managing a set, this edit,
                            and its twin edit at the end of the video, were intended to drive home a feeling of occultism. Here, with its pulsating,
                            tendril-edged circle, and the whisphering, rising in the background.

                        <h3>Title Cards</h3>
                        <p>
                            In previous retrospectives, the chapter title cards were often integrated with the film; for example,
                            in "The Wolf House" with the name of its first chapter — as the door opened, the text was revealed. 
                            However, in this case, I wanted (rather, needed) them to stand on their own; in Häxan, the camera is
                            motionless, preventing the same kind of "kinetic" edits I had used in the past. In an effort to remain
                            consistent, all 3 chapter title cards look and transition the same: a small graphic with moving edges
                            and jitter, chosen to represent either the subject of that chapter or the title itself; and a roughened,
                            linear wipe to transition to that chapter's content.

                            The most pressing concern was figuring out how to handle still images.

                            you've cut out half the available screenspace.
