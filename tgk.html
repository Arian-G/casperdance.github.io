                    <p>
                        Arthurian legend is no stranger to reinterpretation — nor should it be. It's a constantly
                        evolving mythos, and with David Lowery's <span class="tertiary_highlight">The Green
                        Knight</span>, we have the latest of such. Just like the poem before it, the film follows
                        Gawain as he embarks on a fantastical quest to confront the Green Knight. This retrospective
                        covers the film's narrative, themes, and technical elements.

                    <p>
                        The first problem was deciding <span class="tertiary_highlight">how to structure the
                        script</span>. The easiest option (in this case, the worst) was chronological order —
                        narrate over the film's plot beat by beat and leave room for tangents where appropriate. For
                        example, in the film's 4th chapter, "a Kindness", Gawain is robbed and left for dead. 
                        It's his imagining of the future, shown in 360° panoramic rotation, that provided a
                        perfect jumping-off point to discuss the film's camerawork and visual motifs.

                        Of course, being the easiest option, it came with its fair share of problems. Following a
                        chronological order led to many boring summarizations: "Gawain did this. Then Gawain did
                        that", and so on until I arrived at something worth talking about. What's more, a discussion on
                        anything, be it art direction, soundtrack, etc., must first consider where it's best featured
                        within the film. Where, for example, are the anachronisms most prominent? The answer to that
                        question, not viewer comprehension or organization, determined where I discussed it in the script.
                        In this case — it was the 7th chapter, "an Exchange of Winnings". This is not to mention that 
                        "The Green Knight" is a film for which plot is unimportant; it eschews that in favor
                        of theme, character, and a Medieval travelogue. Why, then, the chronological order? 
                        Looking back on it now, I realize <span class="tertiary_highlight">it wasn't the best approach</span>.
                        There were exceptions, sure, but it was a driving force behind a lot of 
                        what didn't work; among other problems, it lent itself to an overly long and, at times, boring video.

                        Regardless of the actual execution, this is a good example of a well-motivated and consistent edit. The
                        motif (circle of life; change of seasons) is omnipresent in the film and is often reflected, visually, within this
                        retrospective.

                        One consequence of the (near) 38-minute runtime was the approach to editing — it was all over the place. Some
                        edits fit, either within the context of the video or as a reflection of the film (e.g., the circular, rotational
                        motifs). Others did not. Take, for example, the following set of retrospective stills, shown below, showcasing
                        the transition of the 3rd chapter title card from black-and-white to color. Sure, it's "cool" (and I like
                        the transition of the subtitle text alongside it), but it's also <span class="tertiary_highlight">
                        unmotivated, inconsistent, and antithetical to the film</span>. The black-and-white in this sequence exists for no 
                        other reason than to make this edit; it's uncommon (this is the first use of it, 11 minutes into the video) and it 
                        makes no sense in a film for which color is so important.

                        Admittedly, runtime wasn't the only motivating factor behind these decisions — <span class="tertiary_highlight">
                        I wanted to try new things</span>, to experiment,
                        to "throw everything at the wall and see what sticks". And I did. Most of the sequences I take issue with are ones I've 
                        since iterated on (or plan to) in future projects. For example, in "Häxan", with its approach to still images. It was 
                        indulgent — but still an important building block nonetheless; now I'm far more aware of what works and what doesn't.

                    <p>
                        Of all the time spent editing this video, most of it was relegated to the first chapter, a roughly 7-minute
                        precursor summarizing the original poem and some of its textual readings — "A Window of Many Colored Glass."
                        The difficulties associated were manifold: how do I sustain a 7-minute discussion on the poem, a discussion
                        that would require the use of numerous still images; how do I make those still images engaging and
                        dynamic; if I am to use footage, what footage do I use? What resulted was an ugly compromise, a repititous
                        cycling of the same few manuscript illustrations, and a narration backgrounded with footage from "The Green
                        Knight" that often contradicted (or was irrelvant to) what was being said. I even included a disclaimer
                        stating as much: "The footage shown during this chapter is not a one-to-one representation of the poem."
                        How embarassing; I was aware of this being an issue in as easly as the scriptwriting stage — but did nothing
                        to solve it.

                        I think I understood from the start that the scope of this video should be broad, should cover the 
                        material the film meant to adapt; a discussion on "The Green Knight" necessitated, too, a discussion on 
                        "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight", for completeness sake. The "retrospective" title is a catch-all,
                        in that way, accomodating the inclusion of these more secondary elements. So, for as much consternation
                        as this chapter caused me, <span class="tertiary_highlight">I don't regret including it</span>. 
                        It was, at least, an important learning experience,
                        a headache that I immediately revised in the following retrospective (and will continue to, going forward).

                        As an aside, the following title cards are two (albeit, minor) elements I'm still happy with. Both make some
                        use of the footage they're overlayed atop of, with the former using an elongated hyphen as a sort of "garrote"
                        or "guillotine" on the Green Knight, a visual representation of the text itself. Integrating it, having it
                        interact with the footage in this way, is something I'd like to explore more of in the future.

                        Generally speaking, the split-screen designs are an intentional, stylistic choice. For better or worse, 
                        it's an aesthetic I like to follow. But here, in the images shown below (and in some other examples),
                        it was not; instead, rather a reaction to YouTube's CopyrightID system.

                        The mirroring in the first image, the black-and-white in both — all of these were concessions made in order
                        to upload the video to YouTube. Often it's these longer sequences, unedited snippets from the film, that are 
                        most affected, understandably so. But "The Green Knight" was an exception, facing copyright claims throughout,
                        even for heavily edited sequences. It was the constant back-and-forth — edit, export, upload, wait for claims,
                        then repeat all over again — that led me toward "Häxan", a film in the public domain, for the following retrospective.
