                    <p>
                        Arthurian legend is no stranger to reinterpretation — nor should it be. It's a constantly
                        evolving mythos, and with David Lowery's <span class="tertiary_highlight">The Green
                        Knight</span>, we have the latest of such. Just like the poem before it, the film follows
                        Gawain as he embarks on a fantastical quest to confront the Green Knight. This retrospective
                        covers the film's narrative, themes, and technical elements.

                    <p>
                        The first problem was deciding <span class="tertiary_highlight">how to structure the
                        script</span>. The easiest option (in this case, the worst) was chronological order —
                        narrate over the film's plot beat by beat and leave room for tangents where appropriate. For
                        example, in the film's 4th chapter, "a Kindness", Gawain is robbed and left for dead in a
                        forest. It's his imagining of the future, shown in 360° panoramic rotation, that provided a
                        perfect jumping-off point to discuss the film's camerawork and visual motifs.

                        Of course, being the easiest option, it came with its fair share of problems. Following a
                        chronological order led to many boring summarizations: "Gawain did this. Then Gawain did
                        that", and so on until I arrived at something worth talking about. What's more, a discussion on
                        anything, be it art direction, soundtrack, etc., must first consider where it's best featured
                        within the film. Where, for example, are the anachronisms most prominent? The answer to that
                        question, <i>not</i> viewer comprehension or organization, determined where I discussed it in the script.
                        In this case — it was the 7th chapter, "an Exchange of Winnings". This is not to mention that 
                        "The Green Knight" is a film for which plot is unimportant; it eschews that in favor
                        of theme, character, and a Medieval travelogue. Why, then, the chronological order? 
                        Looking back on it now, I realize <span class="tertiary_highlight">it wasn't the best approach</span>.
                        There were exceptions, sure, but it was a driving force behind a lot of 
                        what didn't work; among other problems, it lent itself to an overly long and, at times, boring video.

                        Regardless of the actual execution, this is a good example of a well-motivated and consistent edit. The
                        motif (circle of life; change of seasons) is omnipresent in the film and is often reflected, visually, within this
                        retrospective.

                        One consequence of the (near) 38-minute runtime was the approach to editing — it was all over the place. Some
                        edits fit, either within the context of the video or as a reflection of the film (e.g., the circular, rotational
                        motifs). Others did not. Take, for example, the following set of retrospective stills, shown below, showcasing
                        the transition of the 3rd chapter title card from black-and-white to color. Sure, it's "cool" (and I like
                        the transition of the subtitle text alongside it), but it's also <span class="tertiary_highlight">
                        unmotivated, inconsistent, and antithetical to the film</span>. The black-and-white in this sequence exists for no 
                        other reason than to make this edit; it's uncommon (this is the first use of it, 11 minutes into the video) and it 
                        makes no sense in a film for which color is so important.

                        The following images illustrate issues with captioning and visual theme. The former shows the
                        use of guillemets (French quotations, present throughout the entire retrospective) instead of English ones; again, 
                        another instance of form over function. It's not in and of itself a big deal (and I would do it again), but it <i>is</i>
                        emblematic of a larger problem (see also the inconsistent footage sizings in this same example). The latter image 
                        showcases a similar problem; the sequence in question uses different effects, font, and font color to deliniate 
                        between footage from this film and "Sword of the Valiant". However, unlike other similar sequences, it's the only one to do
                        so and, as a result, feels jarring and out-of-place.

                        Admittedly, runtime wasn't the only motivating factor behind these decisions — I wanted to try new things, to experiment,
                        to "throw everything at the wall and see what sticks". And I did. Most of the sequences I take issue with are ones I've 
                        since iterated on (or plan to) in future projects. For example, in Häxan, with the approach to still images. It was 
                        indulgent — but still an important building block nonetheless; now I'm more aware of what I like and dislike.
